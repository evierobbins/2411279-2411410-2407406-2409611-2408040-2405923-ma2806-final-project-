## Game overview

Our game is based on a cat and mouse in which the player is the mouse working their way through a maze made using collisions. The aim of the game is to use the wasd keys to navigate the maze, collect 3 cheese and get to the end whilst avoiding colliding with the cats that are following you.

## Individual Contributions

Evie - Created the tiles and collisions maps as well as introducing the enemy class of the cat and attempting to get it to follow the players co-ordinates at a specific speed. The code with the mouse being followed by the cat was originally working but has since broken and haven't managed to figure out how to fix it. Also attempted to do some debugging and was able to fix our code a few times through this but haven't been able to fix this version. Had we had more time I would've hopefully been able to figure out why our code was broken and also wanted to get the cat to follow the mouse around the collisions.

Liz - My contribution was originally adding in original art work for the game. The other members expressed how they wanted a birds eye view of the mouse, maze and cat so I did my best to implement that through pixel art. There is only one mouse design but I coloured 4 different cats, one for each theme of the map, as well as prepared tilemaps for 4 different seasons. In the file you will also be able to find prototypes of the original grassy land and hedges I had done but were unhappy with so I recoloured the ground to look less intesnse and changed the hedge for mudpatches. I also prepared 4 different rotations for the mouse as I also coded the direction he faces as he moves. Due to my previous project I added in a splash page for the beginning of the game and would like to have implemented a points sytem if I had more time. 

Micha - My role was to help with the movement of the player by using the W, A, S and D keys. Though it was working at first, the player was only moving one block at a time but we needed it to move continuously as long as one of the keys was held down in which I tried to figure out how to do so. After some debugging, I was able to get this to work but the player movement was too slow and was sometimes going through the walls. To fix this, I changed a few things such as changing some of the variables and trying out a few solutions from online forums and videos but it somehow was still not working so I ended up going back to the previous code. Though challenging, I was able to somewhat get the player to move though it was not how we wanted it to be; more debugging and time would have helped greatly in figuring out the solution to this problem.

Molly -  I took part in helping with the movements of the sprite in our game. Due to only getting the sprite to move in bits, a lot of trial and error was done, along with some support from p5.js along with our worsshop's notion class lessons. With more attempts with my code I managed to get the character to move a little more smoothly, however this didn't last for long as I tried to get it the same with all directions, despite trying to debug it. After more attempts of moving the sptite correctly, I decided to leave it as what I got, which was still a movable character using keys. However, with more time and skill, I'd be able to be more confident in what I'd need to do.

Emma- My role in the group was to help the game with classes and tiles essentially with the overall movement some of the code was used from the notion lectures. The classes code help the game to become more accessible and simple to use, the classes has its own abilties and strengths allowing the game to run more smoothly. I aslo used help from p5.js and Molly within the group our code was more of a team collabration so nobody was left really strugglling on their own.
## Themes and Inspirations

Cat and mouse, Pacman style, Maze, 90s theme graphics/game inspired by beloved childhood TV show Tom and Jerry

## Game Design

Booleans, Collisions, Classes, Tilemaps, Movement, Rotation, Different stages and functions, Debugging, Display, if and else, for loops.

## Narrative

Since our game is broken we were unable to complete the full narrative - essentially the player has to collect the three pieces of cheese whilst avoiding the enemy cats and get to the end of the maze to complete.

## Anything We Would Add

As mentioned above we planned to have different seasons for multiple mazes (have attached the original artwork for these) but didn't manage to complete these in time. We wanted to code in collisions with the cats which would produce a game over screen as well as have the mouse able to collect the pieces of cheese - then when the player gets to the end of the game set it up so if they have collected all three cheese they can 'win' otherwise they have to go back - would've possibly used an if/else for this?

We also wanted multiple cats moving at different speeds. We wanted to implement a random feature for cats to have some random movement etc but again struggled to code this. 

We would've also wanted to add a point system where it shows how many pieces of cheese the player has collected in the corner and perhaps a time function too so create a sense of urgency in the game.
